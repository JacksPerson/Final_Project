Description: Severe virus infecton detected on host.  I have contained the unit and will have it reimaged.


Severe Virus infection, warranting notification of reimage. Ticket number 4578864 has been entered by IOT. Due to the severity of virus activity the machine will be/nreimaged.  Internet traffic patterns suggest it is infected with a virus that cannot be cleaned by FireEye.  Any user of this computer should reset their network password
immediately. (Password should be changed to something completely different from their old password -  ie, Do not simply append a number to the old password).
(A support tech will be in contact with the user to have the machine reimaged under the request ticket number 4578864)

Please speak with the employee in an attempt to discover the source of this infection.  Actions should be taken to remove this source.   Actions to be considered:
1.            Restrict internet activity
2.            Do not allow USB drives to be used on the machine
3.            Education of employees on identification of spam email messages
4.            Review of appropriate internet use
5.            Discourage use of personal email (hotmail, gmail etc.) on state computers.

Thank you for your assistance in this matter.
